## :boy: About me 

I am Piotr Sobolewski. I graduated from finance and accounting at the University of Economics in Pozna≈Ñ. <br>
I work as a demand planner. I make forecasts, prepare sales plans and check stock at the warehouse. Also, I am responsible for proper store stock and allocating goods to the stores where needed. In addition, I work with buying and logistics teams. I contact local and global suppliers.  <br>
Currently, I am interested in changing my career path and want to start gaining experience in IT. I have just finished testing workshop organized by    Dare IT.
